# LogSee

## What is LogSee?

LogSee is an application for centralised log management, designed to be lightweight as all other alternatives are either over complicated or very resource heavy

It will be eventually available in a dockerized form, but we are focusing on getting LogSee made before we make that step. We may also package it in .deb or .exe form, dependant on how we end up structuring it.
