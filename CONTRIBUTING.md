# Contributing to LogSee

First off, thanks for taking the time out of your life to spend coding on our application. 

The following is a set of guidelines that github give us free internet points for writing out and also helps us set some basic rules for when contributing.

## What do I need to know before I get started?

Check out the Wiki page called "Developer Quickstart", this contains a list of packages you'll need on your system to be able to test the code.
LogSee is built in a semi modular fasion, check out the Notifications folder on the Server section to get a good idea of how we've done things.

We dev using the VsCode editor, with GitLens and Code Runner installed, but this is up to you, we just like that ide. I guess we're a bit weird...

## I'm all set! How do I get stuck in?

Simple, grab a  bug out of the list, or a feature, or whatever you want! all bugs and issues will be tracked in the Issues tab of github. Just pick one and off you go
please do one issue / bug / feature per pull request. this makes our lives easier to make sure nothing breaks when we merge it. 

### Commit messages

we have two rules for commit messages.

1. The message must clearly explain why you have made a change, and explain what it is doing if it is not immediatley clear upon looking at the code submitted
2. Every major commit number (ie. 100) you must have a funny message. Link a relevant meme or something. Please no foul language, we like to be funny but naughty words make us look poo.

### Documentation

if you create something that needs explaining to an user of LogSee, for example a configuration variable or a new feature that may require a tutorial, please add it into the Wiki.
if we deem it to need a wiki page and one is not written, we will not merge the PR until it has been created.

## Message from us

Most of all have fun! get comfy at your desk, sit naked, drink beer, eat tremendous amounts of food, and crack on! (that's all we do!) 

It's a shameless plug, but I love to code to music, so here is a spotify playlist I have that I listen to, if you wanna listen to the same awful music Ainsey listens to, here is the link:
