This is a document that explains the LogSee client config.json file

Any configuration in this file can be edited via the LogSee client web interface, however some people may not wish to run the web interface and configure via this file.

This document will show the default settings and their meanings

ClientSideFiltering= False -  if enabled, client will only send data that's filtered, else, sends all the data and the server filters this out. If enabled, the LogSee client will utilize more resources. Filters can be configured in the config file or the web interface

[Webui]
Enable = True - this enables the web interface for configuration of the LogSee client. Set to False to disable
Port = 1337 - This is the port the web interface runs on.
IP = 0.0.0.0 - This is the IP that the client web interface listens on, if set to 0.0.0.0 it will listen on all available, else set something like 127.0.0.1 for loopback

[PathsToScan]
This is an array of the files that the logsee client will scan.
an example is:

{
    "Name": "Family Photos",
    "Location": "C:\\Users\\Popzi\\Documents\\GitHub\\LogSee\\out.txt",
    "ScanDirectory": true
},

Name is an identifier that you can set to anything you like
Location is the path to the file or folder on disk
ScanDirectory = True - This should be set to true to pick up all .log files in the directory. 
This means instead of specifying the specific files you want, you can specify the directory and it will recursivley parse all .log files in there. It will ignore anything with a name such as .log.1 or .log.tz, this should be set to false if specifying an individual file
